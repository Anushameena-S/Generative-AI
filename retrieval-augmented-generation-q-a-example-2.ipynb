We have discussed how some\\namount of variation is produced even during asexual reproduction. And\\nthe number of successful variations are maximised by the process of\\nsexual reproduction. If we observe a field of sugarcane we find very little\\nvariations among the individual plants. But in a number of animals\\nincluding human beings, which reproduce sexually, quite distinct\\nvariations are visible among different individuals.
