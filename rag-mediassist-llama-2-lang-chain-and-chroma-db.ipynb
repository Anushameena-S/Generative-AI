It may also include significant behavioral changes lasting at least a month and of ongoing worry about the implications or concern about having other attacks. The latter are called anticipatory attacks (DSM-IVR). Panic disorder is not the same as agoraphobia (fear of public places), although many afflicted with panic disorder also suffer from agoraphobia. Panic attacks cannot be predicted, therefore an individual may become stressed, anxious or worried wondering when the next panic attack will occur. Panic disorder may be differentiated as a medical condition, or chemical imbalance. The DSM-IV-TR describes panic disorder and anxiety differently. Whereas anxiety is preceded by chronic stressors which build to reactions of moderate intensity that can last for days, weeks or months, panic attacks are acute events triggered by a sudden, out-of-the-blue cause: duration is short and symptoms are more intense. Panic attacks can occur in children, as well as adults. Panic in young people may be particularly distressing because children tend to have less insight about what is happening, and parents are also likely to experience distress when attacks occur.\\nTestsAndProcedures: ['Psychotherapy', 'Mental health counseling', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Depression screen (Depression screening)', 'Toxicology screen', 'Psychological and psychiatric evaluation and therapy']\\ncommonMedications: ['Lorazepam', 'Alprazolam (Xanax)', 'Clonazepam', 'Paroxetine (Paxil)', 'Venlafaxine (Effexor)', 'Mirtazapine', 'Buspirone (Buspar)', 'Fluvoxamine (Luvox)', 'Imipramine', 'Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)', 'Clomipramine', 'Acamprosate (Campral)']\"),\n",

It is the most common birth defect regarding male genitalia. In unique cases, cryptorchidism can develop later in life, often as late as young adulthood. About 3% of full-term and 30% of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism is distinct from monorchism the condition of having only one testicle.\\nTestsAndProcedures: ['Complete physical skin exam performed (ML)', 'Ultrasonography (Ultrasound)', 'Pelvis exam', 'Rectal examination', 'Other OR therapeutic procedures; male genital', 'Other OR therapeutic nervous system procedures', 'Occupational therapy assessment (Speech therapy)']\\ncommonMedications: ['Haemophilus B Conjugate Vaccine (Obsolete)', 'Hepatitis B Vaccine (Obsolete)', 'Rotavirus Vaccines (Rotavirus Vaccine)', 'Desoximetasone Topical']\"),\n",
